## Code of Conduct

Since this is an official O'Reilly Training, we will adhere to the [O'Reilly conferences Code of Conduct](http://www.oreilly.com/conferences/code-of-conduct.html).

_"At O'Reilly, we assume that most people are intelligent and well-intended, and we're not inclined to tell people what to do. However, we want every O'Reilly conference to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. To that end, this code of conduct spells out the behavior we support and don't support at conferences."_
